        The Engine class is used to build the computational graph, the starting node is the node that
        the .backward function is called on (last node in the graph). Therefore, the topological sort needs to be
        reversed for backpropagation.

        IMPORTANT NOTE: The graph for backpropagation needs to be returned in reverse order, the behaviour of the
        two DFS algorithms is different. The recursive DFS will add child nodes after there parents, returning the
        graph sorted from the first created node to the last; therefore the order needs to be reversed. The iterative
        DFS will add child nodes before there parents, returning the graph sorted from the last created node to the
        first; therefore the order does not need to be reversed.

        Args:
            start_node (Node): The node to start the topological sort from.
            mode (str): The mode to use for the depth-first search traversal, either iterative or recursive
            reverse (bool): True if the order should be reversed, False otherwise.
